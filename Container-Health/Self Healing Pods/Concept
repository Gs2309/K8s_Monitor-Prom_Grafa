Kubernetes have the capability to Auto Restart the containers when they fail. 
  1. With Always Policy, containers always restart even if the container is completed successfully. 
  2. On failure is only working if container Process exits with Error code. Use this policy on the application that needs to be run successfully and then Stop.  
  3. Never allow the container to never restart even the container liveness probe failed. Use this for applications that Run only Once and never automatically restart.
