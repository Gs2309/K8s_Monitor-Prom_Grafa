How to Install Prometheus and Grafana on Kubernetes using Helm 3:
=================================================================

Prometheus is an open-source systems monitoring and alerting toolkit originally built at SoundCloud. It records real-time metrics in a time series database built using a HTTP pull model, with flexible queries and real-time alerting. It can absorb huge amount of data every second.

The Alertmanager handles alerts sent by client applications such as the Prometheus server. It takes care of deduplicating, grouping, and routing them to the correct receiver integration such as email, PagerDuty, or MS teams etc. It also takes care of silencing and inhibition of alerts.

Grafana is open source visualization and analytics software. It allows you to query, visualize, alert on, and explore your metrics no matter where they are stored. It provides charts, graphs, and alerts for the web when connected to supported data sources such as Prometheus, graphite etc.
